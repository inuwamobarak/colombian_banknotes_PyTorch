# FakeBanknote COP recognition Using PyTorch
In this project, Deep learning algorithm is used to predict fake COP banknotes. The core library is [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org). Transfer learning was used to transfer weights from the ResNet series of pretrained models. For the complete project on the deployment of the model visit my [gitHub](https://github.com/inuwamobarak/cop_banknotes)

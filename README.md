# FakeBanknote COP recognition Using PyTorch
In this repository, deep learning algorithm is used to predict fake COP banknotes and deployed using streamlit. The core library is [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org). Transfer learning was used to transfer weights from the ResNet series of pretrained models.
